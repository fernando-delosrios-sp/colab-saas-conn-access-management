## 2026-06-26 - [Filter Injection in API Queries]

**Vulnerability:** User-controlled input (`name`) was being interpolated directly into query filters (e.g. `name eq "${name}"`) without escaping in `src/isc-client.ts`. An attacker could inject unescaped double quotes to break out of the string literal and inject malicious filter conditions.
**Learning:** Directly interpolating unescaped user strings into query structures or API filter parameters leads to injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate queries.
**Prevention:** Always escape user input (like double quotes `"` and backslashes `\`) before injecting it into string-based query filters. Create an escaping utility function (`escapeFilterString`) and apply it consistently.
